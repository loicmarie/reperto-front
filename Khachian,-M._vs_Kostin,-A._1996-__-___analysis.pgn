1.d4 Nf6 2.Nc3 { My friend GM Melik Khachian and I have had many interesting
battles over the years. He is one of the few grandmasters who regularly
employs the Veresov. } 2...d5 3.Bg5 Nbd7 4.f3 h6 5.Bh4 e6?! 6.e4 Be7 7.e5 Nh5 8.Bxe7 Qxe7 9.Nh3! { White threatens to trap the wayward h5-knight
with g4. But the question remains: is g4 really a threat? } ( { Possibly even stronger than } 9.g3 { which RÃ©ti used
in the very first Veresov. } ) 9...c5?! { Allowing the trap. Black sacs a piece to destroy the white centre, but just
doesn't get enough for it. } ( { He probably couldn't, though, stomach the
position after } 9...g5 10.g3 Ng7 11.Qd2 a6 12.Nd1 c5 13.c3 f6 14.f4 { . } ) 10.g4! { The answer is: Yes, g4! is a real threat. } 10...Qh4+ 11.Ke2 { Welcome to
a typical Veresov position! The situation looks irrational and possibly very
dangerous for White, but Khachian shows deep understanding of his lines and
demonstrates that the position is clearly in White's favour, if not winning. } 11...cxd4 12.Qxd4 f6 ( { He can't extricate the knight with } 12...g6?? 13.Nb5! { (hitting c7, and also covering White's queen on d4) } 13...O-O 14.gxh5 { . } ) 13.Qf2! { The power of preparation. What first looked like a dangerous black attack
is now an arrow shot with the strength of a child. Black would have decent
compensation if he could keep the queens on the board. Unfortunately for him,
they come off and he just doesn't have enough against accurate defence. } 13...Qxf2+ 14.Kxf2 fxe5 15.gxh5 O-O 16.Kg2 Nf6?! ( 16...Rf5 { puts up more resistance,
but still fails to } 17.Bd3 Rxh5 18.Bg6 Rh4 19.Rhe1 b6 20.Nf2 Bb7 21.Nd3 e4 22.Kg3! ( { certainly not } 22.fxe4?? Rg4+ ) 22...Nf8 23.Ne5 Nxg6 24.Nxg6 Rh5 25.h4! Kh7 26.Nf4 Re5 27.fxe4 dxe4 28.Rad1 { and White wins without
trouble. } ) 17.Re1 e4 18.fxe4 d4 19.Nd1 e5 ( 19...Nxh5 20.Be2 Nf6 21.e5 { is also quite joyless for Black. } ) 20.Be2 Be6 21.Ndf2 Rac8 22.Rc1 Bf7 23.Rhf1 Nxh5 24.Bxh5 Bxh5 25.Nd3 Rfe8 26.Ng1! ( { Preparing to hit the e5-pawn
a second time with Nf3 and also denying Black even a trace of counterplay like
in the line } 26.Rf5? Bg6 27.Rxe5 Rxe5 28.Nxe5 Bxe4+ 29.Kg3 Bxc2 { when
Black is still busted but at least has some hope. } ) 26...Rc7 27.Nf3 Rec8 ( { Passive defence with } 27...Rce7 28.c3 Bg6 29.Rfe1 { doesn't improve matters. } ) 28.Rf2 Bg6 29.Re2 Bf7 30.a3 { The e5-pawn is not running away. } 30...Bc4 31.Nfxe5 Bb5 32.Rd2 Re8 33.Re1 Rce7 34.Nf3 Rxe4 35.Rxe4 Rxe4 36.Nf2! { Summary: White has a wealth of good moves in this line on move nine, including
9 Nh3!. }  1-0
